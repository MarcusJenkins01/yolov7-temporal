This repository will host the code for our paper, [Improving Object Detection for Time-Lapse Imagery Using Temporal Features in Wildlife Monitoring].

Note: The code is still being prepared and adapted for general use. Currently, it is tailored to the specific datasets and configurations used in our experiments. Updates will follow soon to make it more flexible and widely applicable.
